# ECT App - Performance & Stability Improvements

## BAFs now follows the app's light/dark theme; PDF viewer zoom rewritten
**Date**: September 23, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — `bafs-study-planner.html` and `pdf-viewer.js` updated. No native rebuild needed.

### Added
- **BAFs App now matches the main app's light/dark theme.** It's same-origin with the main app (both served from the same host), so it reads the exact same `localStorage.getItem('theme')` key directly — no cross-frame messaging needed. Added a dark variant of every `--md-*` CSS custom property (surface/background/text/outline/error), applied via a `.dark` class on `<html>`, set as early as possible (before first paint, matching how `index.html` avoids a flash of the wrong theme) with a `prefers-color-scheme` fallback for a first-ever visit with no stored preference yet. Also added a `storage` event listener so a theme change made elsewhere is picked up if this page is already loaded in the background, not just on its next fresh load. The colorful countdown banner and the PDF viewer's own chrome are deliberately left as-is — a fixed dark toolbar regardless of app theme is the normal convention for document viewers (Chrome's and Google Drive's PDF viewers both do this).

### Fixed
- **PDF viewer pinch-zoom rewritten — the previous implementation used the CSS `zoom` property, which is a non-standard, legacy (IE-origin) property with known cross-engine inconsistencies, especially applying it to a `flex` container the way the continuous-scroll page column needed. Symptom-wise this could show up as zoom not engaging reliably, snapping back unexpectedly, or not composing cleanly with scrolling.** Replaced with the standard approach: `transform: scale()` on the page column, paired with a wrapping element whose explicit `width`/`height` is kept in sync with the current scale — that's what makes the native `overflow: auto` scroll container's scrollable area actually grow when zoomed in, so panning around a zoomed page is just normal scrolling, with no custom pan/translate code needed at all. Pinch zoom is now anchored at the midpoint between the two fingers (and double-tap at the tap point), so the spot you're zooming into stays under your fingers instead of the view jumping. Also fixed a real bug in the old gesture code: releasing a pinch (fingers rarely lift at the exact same instant) could fire a spurious double-tap-zoom toggle when the first finger lifted while the second was still down — the touch-end handler now requires zero fingers remaining before it's treated as a tap.

## Reverted BAFs back to an iframe; PDF viewer now escapes it via postMessage instead
**Date**: September 23, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — `search.js`, `main.js`, `bafs-study-planner.html`, `pdf-viewer.js`, `index.html` updated. Native rebuild not required for this entry (no `MainActivity.java` changes).

The previous entry's "real top-level navigation instead of an iframe" approach is reverted based on testing: it traded the boxed-in-iframe PDF viewer problem for a worse set of problems (status bar padding broke, hardware back got confusing, and a pre-existing auto-select-BAFs-on-Search-tab behavior turned into an unwanted full navigation away from the app on open). BAFs is back to being an `<iframe>` in the Search/Discover tab, exactly as before. Only the PDF viewer itself needed to be genuinely full-screen, and that's now solved without needing BAFs itself to leave the iframe.

### Fixed
- **Icons not rendering in the PDF viewer.** `pdf-viewer.js` used `material-symbols-outlined` icon-font classes for its back/lock/error icons. That class is defined on the main app's page but `bafs-study-planner.html` uses a different icon-font class (`.msr`) — so on the BAFs page (where the icon-loading bug was reported), those spans rendered as invisible blanks. Replaced with inline SVG for all three icons — no font dependency at all now, renders identically regardless of what (if anything) the host page has loaded.
- **Unable to go back / close the full-screen PDF viewer.** Root cause was structural: opening the viewer doesn't push any history entry, so on a page with no listener overriding it, Android's hardware back button would act on the *host page's* own navigation instead of the (invisible, per the bug above) viewer sitting on top of it. Combined with the icon bug, the close button was both invisible and, depending on where the PDF was opened from, not actually wired to the thing on screen. Fixed as a side effect of the postMessage rework below — the viewer now only ever lives in the main app's own document, where it was already correctly registered in the hardware back-button hierarchy (`pdfv-overlay` in `main.js`'s `modalHierarchy`, checked before anything else).
- **Status bar padding not taking effect.** `padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px)` was already on the PDF viewer's top bar, but neither `index.html` nor `bafs-study-planner.html`'s `<meta name="viewport">` declared `viewport-fit=cover` — without it, every `env(safe-area-inset-*)` value is defined to resolve to `0`, so that padding was a no-op on every device regardless of actual status bar height. Added `viewport-fit=cover` to both.

### Changed
- **BAFs App is an `<iframe>` again** (reverted from the previous entry's top-level-navigation approach). `search.js`'s `loadDiscoverList('bafs')` and `main.js`'s hardware back-button handling (the `bafsIframe`/`bafsIsAtHome`/`bafsGoBack` bridge) are back to their original form; `bafs-study-planner.html`'s `window.bafsIsAtHome`/`bafsGoBack` bridge functions and its temporary standalone-page top bar (added last entry, no longer applicable once embedded again) are restored/removed to match.
- **`pdf-viewer.js` now works correctly from inside an iframe.** When it detects it's running embedded (`window.top !== window.self`), `openPdfViewer()`/`closePdfViewer()` no longer render locally — they `postMessage` the request to the top-level document instead, which (also running this same script) renders the overlay itself. A `position: fixed; inset: 0` overlay is only ever full-screen relative to its own document's viewport, so rendering it in the actual top-level page — instead of inside BAFs's 70vh iframe box — is what makes it genuinely cover the whole device screen. The receiving side checks `event.origin` against the page's own origin before acting on a message, so content in *other* iframes (e.g. the arbitrary third-party pages the in-app browser loads) can't trigger it.

## BAFs App: real top-level page instead of an iframe, with a shimmer transition
**Date**: September 23, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — `search.js`, `main.js`, `bafs-study-planner.html` updated.

### Changed
- **BAFs App is no longer loaded via `<iframe>`.** Tapping the "BAFs App" pill now shows the existing `LIST_SKELETON` shimmer in `#discover-list-container` for an instant response, then does a real `window.location.href = 'bafs-study-planner.html'` navigation. Two direct motivations: (1) the full-screen PDF viewer's `position: fixed; inset: 0` was only ever full-screen relative to the 70vh iframe box it lived inside, not the actual device screen — as a real top-level page it now correctly covers the whole viewport; (2) the phone-frame illusion (max-width 412px) was rendering nested inside the iframe's own box, an odd "app inside an app" look that goes away once it's the actual page.
- Removed the now-dead iframe back-button bridge (`window.bafsIsAtHome` / `bafsGoBack`, and the matching check in `main.js`'s hardware back-button handler). Verified this isn't a regression: `bafs-study-planner.html` already manages its own view history via `history.pushState`/`popstate`, and Capacitor's *default* (unlistened) Android back-button behavior is `WebView.goBack()` through that history — which correctly steps back through BAFs's own sub-views first and only then crosses back to the main app, with no extra listener code needed on this page.
- Added a minimal top bar (back arrow + title) to BAFs's home view. It previously had none by design — the comment left in the code explained it assumed the parent app's own header would always be visible around the iframe. That assumption no longer holds now that this is a standalone top-level page, so it needed *some* on-screen way back in, not just the hardware button.

### Known tradeoff — flagging, not fixed
`initSearch()` still auto-calls `setDiscoverTab('bafs')` for students on the `TY B.Com (Accounting & Finance)` course the moment they open the Search/Discover tab. That was harmless as an iframe swap; now that selecting this tab is a real page navigation, those students get auto-redirected away from the app immediately on opening Search, with no tap involved. Left as-is since changing default/auto-selection behavior wasn't part of what was asked — worth a decision on whether that auto-select should become "just highlight the pill" instead of "navigate immediately."

## Shared locked-down PDF viewer + real fix for the "services always open externally" bug
**Date**: September 22, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — new `pdf-viewer.js`, plus `bafs-study-planner.html`, `index.html`, `main.js`, `search.js` updated. Native change also needed: `MainActivity.java` block in `ecampus-android-main`'s `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` (separate repo) — requires an app rebuild, not just a web deploy. This entry supersedes the PDF-viewer half of the previous entry below: the paginated per-BAFs-page viewer with Download/Open-Externally buttons was replaced by the locked-down viewer described here (premium/protected study material — no download, no external open, raw URL never touches the DOM).

### Fixed
- **Root cause of "services open externally even when set to in-app" found and fixed.** `openServiceLink()`'s native in-app branch called `await import('@capacitor/browser')` — a bare npm-style specifier that cannot resolve in this deployment (plain `<script type="module">`, no bundler, no import map). That `import()` throws every time, which was silently caught and fell through to the external-browser branch — so `open_in_app = true` never actually worked on native, regardless of what was set when creating the service. Fixed by using `window.Capacitor.Plugins.Browser` instead, the documented no-bundler API — and the one already used correctly elsewhere in this same file (the hardware back-button handler). Same bug, same fix applied to `updateNativeStatusBar()` (`@capacitor/status-bar`), which had a second bug on top: `window.Capacitor.isNative` isn't a real property (it's the method `.isNativePlatform()`), so that whole function was a no-op on every native launch.

### Added
- **`pdf-viewer.js`** — a new shared, dependency-free script (`<script src="pdf-viewer.js"></script>`, one line) giving any page `window.openPdfViewer(url, title)`: full-screen, continuous vertical scroll (matches the native Chrome PDF viewer look), pages lazy-rendered on `<canvas>` via pdf.js as they scroll into view (`IntersectionObserver`), pinch-zoom and double-tap-zoom (via CSS `zoom` on the whole scroll column, so native scrolling keeps working at any zoom level instead of needing custom pan logic). Locked down on purpose: no Download button, no Open-Externally button, the PDF's URL is never written into any `href`/attribute — only ever held in JS memory — and long-press/right-click/text-select are disabled on the viewer. Used by both `bafs-study-planner.html` (replacing its old paginated viewer) and the main app.
- `openServiceLink()` now detects any URL ending in `.pdf` and routes straight to `window.openPdfViewer()` instead of Chrome Custom Tabs / the system browser — regardless of the `open_in_app` setting, since a raw document should never be handed to something that could offer to download it. Because pasted chat links (`messages.js`) and the event post "View Link" button (`post-card.js`) both already funnel through `openServiceLink`, they get this for free with no extra changes.
- `AndroidSecure.enable()` / `.disable()` — new native JS-interface bridge in `MainActivity.java` that toggles `FLAG_SECURE` on the whole app window, blocking screenshots and screen recording (including the Recent Apps thumbnail) while a protected document is on screen. `pdf-viewer.js` calls `enable()` right before showing a document and `disable()` on close. Note this is a whole-window flag — there's no way to secure just the viewer region — so the entire app is briefly non-screenshottable while a PDF is open, back to normal the moment it closes.
- The PDF viewer overlay is registered in the app's hardware-back-button hierarchy (`modalHierarchy` in `main.js`), so Android back closes it before falling through to tab-switching or exiting.

## BAFs App: in-app PDF viewer + hardened in-app/external link routing
**Date**: September 22, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — `bafs-study-planner.html`, `main.js`, `messages.js`, `post-card.js` updated. Native change also needed: `MainActivity.java` block in `ecampus-android-main`'s `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` (separate repo) — requires an app rebuild, not just a web deploy.

### Fixed
- **PDFs (Question Bank / PYQ / Notes / search results) were downloading or bouncing to an external browser instead of opening in the app.** `openPdf()` called `window.open(url, '_blank')`, which the Capacitor WebView has no real handling for (no multi-window support configured) — it ended up navigating the WebView itself to the raw PDF URL, which WebView can't render, so it fell through to `MainActivity`'s native `DownloadListener` (silent `DownloadManager` download) or, for the Supabase Storage domain specifically, Capacitor's out-of-scope-navigation handoff to an external browser. Neither is "displayed inside the app."
- Fixed by rewriting `openPdf()` into a real in-app viewer: fetches the PDF's bytes with `fetch()` and renders pages on `<canvas>` via pdf.js (cdnjs, v3.11.174) — the WebView is never asked to navigate to the PDF URL at all, so there's nothing for the native download handler or an external browser to intercept. New full-screen `#pdf-viewer` overlay with page nav (buttons + swipe), pinch-zoom/double-tap-zoom/pan (the app's viewport disables native pinch-zoom), a page counter, and explicit "Download" / "Open Externally" buttons — those two are now the *only* way a download or external open happens; neither fires automatically on open.

### Added
- `AndroidLinkHandler.openExternal(url)` — new native JS-interface bridge in `MainActivity.java` that always launches a real `ACTION_VIEW` intent, regardless of the URL's domain. Previously the "open externally" path (`openServiceLink`'s `openInApp=false` branch) relied on `window.open(url, '_system')`, which actually rides on Capacitor's `allowNavigation` domain whitelist rather than being a real explicit choice — if a domain were ever added to that whitelist for an unrelated reason, this would silently stop behaving as "external." `openServiceLink`, `openPdfExternally` (new, in the PDF viewer), and chat-message/event links (see below) all now go through this bridge when present, with the old `_system` behavior kept only as a fallback for app builds that haven't picked up the native change yet.
- Pasted links in chat messages (`messages.js` `linkify()`) and the event post "View Link" button (`post-card.js`) now route through the same hardened opener (`window.openChatLink` → `openServiceLink(url, false)`) instead of a plain `target="_blank"` anchor, which had the identical WebView window-opening ambiguity as the old PDF links.
- Defense-in-depth on the native side: `MainActivity`'s `DownloadListener` now checks for `application/pdf` before falling through to `DownloadManager`, and opens a native PDF-capable app via `ACTION_VIEW` instead of silently downloading — a safety net for any PDF link that isn't yet routed through the in-app viewer above.

## BAFs App: removed the duplicate header, real back-button support, icon shimmer
**Date**: September 20, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — `bafs-study-planner.html` and `main.js` updated

### Changed
- Removed the search bar + chip row (Schedule/Countdown/Q.Bank/Notes/Pattern) from the top of the study planner's Home screen — with the parent app's own search bar right above it, having a second one made the embedded app look like a separate thing pasted in rather than part of the same UI. Per explicit confirmation, this was the only way to reach those sections from Home, so a replacement entry point still needs building separately — `navTo()`/`chipClick()` and the `#view-search` screen themselves are untouched, ready for new navigation to call into.

### Fixed
- **Hardware/browser back button now works inside the embedded app.** It's a same-origin iframe with its own independent session history — the parent's back-button handler (`setupAppBackButton` in `main.js`) only ever saw its own document's history, so a back-press while on a sub-view (Q.Bank, PYQ, etc.) fell straight through to the parent's own fallback (switch tabs / exit) instead of stepping back within the study planner. Fixed by exposing `window.bafsIsAtHome()`/`window.bafsGoBack()` from the iframe (same-origin, so the parent can call them directly, no `postMessage` needed) and checking them in `checkAndCloseTopLayer()` — but only when the Search tab is actually the one visible, since `switchTab()` just toggles a `hidden` class rather than destroying the iframe, so without that check a back-press from an unrelated tab could still find it and misfire.
- **Icon shimmer while the icon font loads.** Material Symbols Rounded loading in over the network used to mean a brief window where every `.msr` icon rendered as its raw fallback text ("search", "calendar_month", etc.) instead of the glyph. Added a `document.fonts.ready`-driven `fonts-loaded` class on `<html>` (with a 3s safety-net timeout), and a CSS rule that shows a shimmer placeholder — reusing the same gradient/animation as this file's existing `.shimmer-bg` — sized to each icon's own box until that class is added. Applies everywhere in the app automatically; no per-icon markup changes needed.

## Popular list tweaks + a temporary "BAFs App" pill for exam season
**Date**: September 20, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — new static file added (`bafs-study-planner.html`), deploy it alongside the rest

### Changed
- Popular now shows top 15 (was 10).
- Removed the connection-count subtitle under names in Popular — rows now show the same subtitle (role/course) as Suggested, nothing extra.

### Added: BAFs App (temporary, exam-season only)
- A third pill, "BAFs App", added alongside Popular/Suggested on the Search/Discover tab.
- It's the **default** selected pill specifically for users whose `course` is exactly `TY B.Com (Accounting & Finance)` — everyone else still defaults to Popular, and can still open the BAFs pill manually, it's just not selected for them automatically.
- The pill embeds a completely separate, self-contained "Study Planner" mini-app (`bafs-study-planner.html`, new file at the project root) via `<iframe>` — its own UI, own JS, and **its own Supabase project** (a different `supabaseUrl`/anon key than the main app, hardcoded in that file exactly as provided). Deliberately not merged into this app's own markup/JS: the standalone app assumes it owns the whole viewport (fixed-size `html`/`body`, its own `#app` id, its own Google Fonts import) and inlining it directly would risk real collisions with this app's CSS and JS in both directions. An iframe keeps the two fully isolated, and makes this genuinely temporary — removing it later is deleting one pill button, one `if` branch in `loadDiscoverList`, and one file, not untangling merged code.

### Deploy note
`bafs-study-planner.html` must be uploaded to the same directory as `index.html` — the iframe references it with a relative path (`src="bafs-study-planner.html"`), so it needs to sit alongside the other app files, not in a subfolder.

### When exam season ends
Remove: the "BAFs App" `<button>` in the Discover pills row (`index.html`), the `if (tab === 'bafs')` branch in `loadDiscoverList` and the course-check in `initSearch` (both in `search.js`), and `bafs-study-planner.html` itself.

## Search/Discover: replaced Featured Services with Popular / Suggested pills
**Date**: September 19, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Changed
- The Featured Services grid on the empty-query Search tab is gone, replaced with two pill-switchable lists below the search box: **Popular** (default) and **Suggested**.
- **Popular** — new `getTopConnectedUsers()` in `data-layer.js`, top 10 users by `connection_count` platform-wide. Cached globally (not per-viewer) since it's the same leaderboard for everyone; the viewer is fetched in a small buffer and filtered out client-side rather than excluded in the query itself, so the shared cache can't end up wrong for a different viewer.
- **Suggested** — same `getUserSuggestions()` data as before, now rendered as a plain list (`renderUserList`) instead of the horizontal card widget, so both pills look and behave the same way.
- `renderUserList` now shows a connection-count subtitle when the row data includes one (Popular only — Suggested rows don't carry `connection_count`, so they render exactly as before).

### Removed
- The entire Featured Services code path in `search.js`: `fetchFeaturedServices`, `groupFeaturedServices`, `renderFeaturedGroup`, `renderFeaturedItem`, `openFeaturedProvider`, `openFeaturedServiceLink`, and the now-unused `FEATURED_SKELETON`/`escapeHtml`/`showToast` that only that code needed. The "Services" tab within active search (typing a query and filtering to Services) is untouched — that's a separate feature (`renderServiceList`) that was never part of this ask.

### Notes
- `saveFeaturedServicesToCache`/`getFeaturedServicesFromCache` in `utils.js` are now fully unused (only caller was the removed code) — left in place rather than touching the IndexedDB object-store setup for a small cleanup, but worth knowing about if `utils.js` gets a pass later.

## Full schema audit, Page broadcast messaging, migration cleanup
**Date**: September 19, 2026
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires running `migration_page_broadcast_v13.sql`'s content (now folded into `schema.sql`, see below) and redeploying `send-push-notification`

### Full trigger/function/RLS audit (via a real dump, not screenshots this time)
Got a proper dump of every function, trigger, and the `messages` RLS policies from the live database. This resolved several things previous entries in this changelog got wrong or left unverified:
- Confirmed `manage_connection`'s exact live source matches what's now in `schema.sql` — the "Correction" and "Reverted" entries above turned out to have the right end state.
- Found the *actual* push mechanism: a raw Postgres trigger (`send_push_on_notification`) calling `supabase_functions.http_request` directly — not a separately-configured "webhook" as a distinct concept, and not named `push-notification-sender` as this repo had been calling it. **Renamed the edge function folder to `supabase/functions/send-push-notification/` to match the real deployed URL.**
- Found a whole dormant table: `hotpost_replies`, with its own working trigger (`trg_hotpost_reply`) that already creates `hotpost_reply` notifications correctly — except nothing in this app writes to that table anymore. `hotposts.js` inserts into `messages` with `hotpost_reply_id` set instead. So the client-side `hotpost_reply` notification is genuinely necessary, confirmed by checking which table is *actually written to*, not just whether a similarly-named trigger exists.
- Found several more orphaned functions (a second `notify_page_followers` overload, `trg_post_like`, `trg_post_unlike`, `trg_post_comment`, a second `cast_poll_vote` overload with real permission checks the simpler one lacks) — documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `schema.sql`, not touched.

### New: Page broadcast messaging
- **Pages can message any user, and be messaged by any user, without a connection.** Added a third, independent permissive RLS policy on `messages` (`messages_insert_page_bypass`) rather than modifying either of the two existing connection-gated ones — Postgres OR's permissive policies together, so ordinary student-to-student messaging is completely unaffected.
- **Broadcast**: a new `campaign` icon in the Messages tab header (Page accounts only) opens a composer that sends one message to *every user on the platform* via `broadcast_page_message(p_content)` — a single server-side `INSERT ... SELECT` per table (messages, notifications), not a client-side loop, so it can't half-complete.
- **Page messages show real content, not "New Chat"**: new `page_message` notification type, distinct from `new_message` — the push shows the sender's actual name and message content. Still respects the global "Messages" push-category toggle, but:
- **Pages can't be muted**: `isMuted()` in `messages.js` returns `false` unconditionally for any Page partner, and the chat's "⋯" menu omits the Mute option entirely (not just disables it) for Page threads — both driven from the same `pagePartnersCache` so they can't drift apart. The edge function also never runs the per-conversation mute check for `page_message` (only `new_message` goes through it).
- Also added a "Message" button to a Page's public profile — there wasn't one at all before (only Follow/Following + the notification-bell toggle).

### Fixed along the way
- `messages.js`'s inbox builder (`deriveThreads()`) resolved every thread partner's name/avatar purely from `acceptedConnections`, and explicitly filtered out any thread whose partner wasn't found there. A Page's message to a non-connection would have been silently invisible in the recipient's inbox — the row would exist in the database, but the thread just wouldn't render. Fixed by resolving non-connection partners who are specifically `role = 'page'` accounts in a separate cache, merged into the same lookup.
- A bug introduced and caught in the same sitting: adding the profile "Message" button initially set `.onclick` on a button before a later, pre-existing line re-set `actionsContainer.innerHTML` (which recreates the DOM nodes) — silently wiping the handler. Moved the wiring to after that reassignment.

### Documentation and cleanup
- New `ARCHITECTURE.md` — full repo documentation: file responsibilities, the complete verified notification system, the messaging model, and every dead/orphaned code path found this session (`discover.js`, the orphaned SQL functions above).
- `schema.sql` substantially rewritten: the `messages` table now has its real column list (was missing 7 columns including `hotpost_reply_id` and `shared_post_id`), the RLS policy section replaced with the actual live policies (was documenting 3 policies with different names than the 5 that actually exist), a new `conversation_settings` table added (was missing entirely), and a large new "Functions & Triggers" section with every verified function/trigger body. The pre-existing CREATE TABLE statements for other tables were left as-is — those were not independently re-verified this pass, and the file says so at the top.
- Deleted `supabase/migration_*_vN.sql` — their content is now captured in `schema.sql`'s verified sections. Five of these (`_v2` through `_v6`) predate this session and were never individually reviewed before deletion; confidence they're safe to remove rests on their table names already matching what's in `schema.sql`, not on direct verification the way `_v9` through `_v13` (this session's own migrations) were confirmed against the live database.

### ⚠️ Deploy steps
1. Redeploy the edge function from its new path: `supabase functions deploy send-push-notification` (and remove the old `push-notification-sender` deployment if it still exists under that name).
2. Apply `messages_insert_page_bypass` and `broadcast_page_message` from `schema.sql`'s "Page fan-out / broadcast" section — this content used to be `migration_page_broadcast_v13.sql`, now deleted.
3. Deploy the updated `main.js`, `messages.js`, `notifications.js`, `index.html`.

## Final pass: removed every duplicate notification, fixed one real trigger bug
**Date**: September 16, 2026
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires running the new migration below.

### What this actually was
A full trigger audit (across `posts`, `post_likes`, `post_comments`, `comment_likes`, `hotposts`, `hotpost_likes`, `messages`, `page_followers`) turned up pre-existing DB triggers already creating notifications for **every single type** I'd added client-side this session, except two. In order:

| Type | Already handled by | Action taken |
|---|---|---|
| `post_like` | `handle_post_like_notification` on `post_likes` | Removed from `feed.js` |
| `comment_like` | `handle_comment_like_notification` on `comment_likes` | Removed from `feed.js` |
| `post_comment` / `comment_reply` / `comment_mention` | `handle_post_comment_notification` on `post_comments` (one function, branches on `parent_comment_id` and loops `mentioned_user_ids`) | Removed from `feed.js` |
| `post_mention` | `on_new_post`'s trigger function on `posts` (identical logic) | Removed from `feed.js` |
| `page_new_post` / `page_new_hotpost` | Turns out to be **my own** `migration_notifications_fanout_v9.sql`, already applied — not a duplicate, just me temporarily confused by seeing my own code reflected back | Left as-is |
| `hotpost_like` | `trg_hotpost_like` on `hotpost_likes` — **but `AFTER INSERT` only** | See below — this one needed a real fix, not just deletion |
| `hotpost_reply` | Nothing (messages-table insert, no matching trigger) | Kept |
| `new_message` | Nothing (messages-table insert, no matching trigger) | Kept |

### The one genuine bug found along the way
`hotpost_likes` uses a soft-delete pattern — unlike sets `is_deleted = true` via `UPDATE`, and liking again reuses the same row via `.upsert(...)`, which resolves as an `UPDATE` once a row already exists, not a fresh `INSERT`. `trg_hotpost_like`'s trigger was `AFTER INSERT` only, so it correctly fired on someone's very first like of a given hotpost, but silently did nothing for every like after an unlike-then-relike cycle. New migration `migration_fix_hotpost_like_trigger_v12.sql` changes the trigger to `AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OF is_deleted`, with the function itself guarding against firing on the unlike transition or unrelated updates.

### Cleanup
- `prepareReply()` reverted to its original two-argument signature — the third (`userId`) argument I'd added to support the now-removed client-side `comment_reply` notification is gone.
- Removed the now-unused `createNotification` import from `feed.js` entirely (nothing in that file creates notifications anymore — every type it used to touch already has a working trigger).
- `feed.js`'s `submitComment` no longer does the extra `.select('id').single()` on the comment insert — that was only ever needed to get the new comment's id for the notification call being removed here.

### Notes for future notification work
This is now the third time this session a "notification never worked" assumption turned out to be wrong once an actual trigger audit was done (connections, then this). The working method going forward: **check `pg_trigger` for the actual table before writing a client-side notification call, every time** — the render/UI side of `notifications.js` having no handling for a type is decent evidence it's missing, but the reverse isn't true: `notifications.js` already correctly handled `post_like`/`comment_reply`/`post_mention` etc. the whole time, which should have been the tell that something upstream was already creating them.

---

## Reverted the manage_connection notification inserts — they were duplicates
**Date**: September 16, 2026
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires running the new migration — see below. Reverts part of the "Correction" update above.

### Root cause (confirmed via the live database, not guesswork this time)
The previous "Correction" entry assumed `connection_request`/`connection_accepted` notifications had never worked, because I only ever had visibility into the `manage_connection` RPC's body, not any triggers on the tables it touches. Turns out there's a pre-existing trigger — `on_connection_upsert` (`AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON connections`, calling `trg_connections()`) — that already inserts these notifications itself: on the `connections` row's INSERT for a request, and on its UPDATE for an accept. That trigger was already working before any of this. Adding my own `INSERT INTO notifications` calls inside `manage_connection` last round created an exact duplicate of what the trigger does — confirmed by querying the table directly and finding two rows with identical `user_id`, `sender_id`, `type`, and the same timestamp down to the microsecond.

### Fixed
- New migration `migration_revert_manage_connection_v11.sql` — puts `manage_connection` back to its original body (no notification inserts), leaving `trg_connections()` as the sole place these get created. That trigger is arguably the more robust design anyway: it fires off the `connections` table itself regardless of which code path changes it, rather than depending on every caller remembering to notify manually.
- The migration file also includes a commented-out cleanup query for the duplicate rows already sitting in your `notifications` table from before this fix — review before uncommenting, since it's a delete.

### Lesson for future notification types
Before assuming a notification type is dead and needs client-side wiring, check for triggers on the tables involved (`pg_trigger` / `pg_get_triggerdef`), not just whatever function body happens to be visible. I got this one wrong initially because a trigger is invisible unless someone thinks to go looking for it specifically — the RPC body alone gave no indication one existed.

## Notifications: new_message was unhandled everywhere it's dispatched
**Date**: September 15, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Fixed
`createNotification({ type: 'new_message' })` started firing in the last update, but nothing that actually *displays or routes* notifications knew about the type — it fell through every dispatch point silently:
- **In-app notification list** (`notifications.js`, `renderNotificationItem`): no `iconMap` entry (generic gray bell), no text branch (rendered as just the sender's name with nothing after it).
- **Tapping that in-app notification**: no branch in `handleNotificationClick` — did nothing at all.
- **Tapping the actual OS push banner** (`pushNotificationActionPerformed` listener): fell to the generic `else`, which opens the notification bell list instead of the conversation.
- **Cold-starting the app from that push** (`main.js`'s pending-route system): same gap, landed on the dashboard instead of the chat.

All four now open the conversation with the sender (`window.openConversation`), and the in-app list shows a proper chat icon and "sent you a message" text — consistent with the push itself being deliberately content-free.

### Notes
Found this by checking whether the new type was actually handled everywhere a notification type gets dispatched, not just where it gets created — worth doing this check for any future notification type too, since there are 4 separate dispatch points that all need updating together.

## Correction: connection notifications moved into manage_connection itself
**Date**: September 15, 2026
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires running the new migration — see below. Supersedes part of the notifications update above.

### What changed
The previous update hooked `connection_request`/`connection_accepted` notifications off `manage_connection`'s return value, client-side in `main.js`, because that RPC's SQL wasn't available. It was shared afterward, so this replaces that hook with the more robust version: both `INSERT INTO notifications` calls now live inside `manage_connection` itself, in the same transaction as the request/accept.

- Removed the client-side hook in `main.js` (`handleConnectionAction`) and the now-unused `createNotification` import there — **do not re-add it**, or connection actions will fire two notifications instead of one.
- New migration `migration_manage_connection_notifications_v10.sql` — full `manage_connection` body, unchanged except for the two new `INSERT`s in the `request` and `accept` branches. Run this migration; it replaces the function.

### Why this is better than the client-side hook
No dependency on the client successfully following up after the RPC call — the notification is created in the exact same transaction as the state change it represents, so it can't drift out of sync or get silently dropped by a closed tab.

### Note
This migration's `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` header (`RETURNS text`, `SECURITY DEFINER`) was reconstructed from what the function body needs, since only the body was shared — check that against your actual declaration before running if it was set up differently.

## Notifications were mostly never firing — wired up the whole system
**Date**: September 15, 2026
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires 2 SQL migrations AND redeploying the push edge function — see below

### The actual bug
`notifications.js` already had complete render/click-handling support for every type in the push edge function's `titleMap` — icons, preview text, tap-to-open. But almost nothing in the app ever *created* a row in the `notifications` table to trigger any of it. The only type that worked end-to-end was `new_follower`. Likes, comments, replies, mentions, and connection requests all did nothing, silently.

### Added — new shared helper
`createNotification()` in `data-layer.js` — one place that handles "never notify yourself" and error handling, used by every call site below instead of repeating insert boilerplate 10+ times.

### Wired up (previously dead)
- **feed.js**: `post_like`, `comment_like`, `post_comment`, `comment_reply`, `post_mention`, `comment_mention`. Author/target ids are read straight off existing DOM attributes (`post-options-btn`'s `data-user-id`, a comment row's `data-comment-owner-id`) rather than extra queries, except a couple of small necessary lookups (the comment's own id, the reply target's id — `window.prepareReply` now takes a third `userId` argument).
- **hotposts.js**: `hotpost_like` (both the tap and double-tap paths) and `hotpost_reply`. Kept `hotpost_reply` as its own distinct type rather than folding it into the new generic chat notification below, since the edge function already has a richer, reply-content-aware treatment for it.
- **main.js**: `connection_request` / `connection_accepted`, hooked off the result string `manage_connection` (a server-side RPC not in this repo) already returns — didn't need to touch that RPC at all.
- **New migration** `migration_notifications_fanout_v9.sql`: `page_new_post` / `page_new_hotpost` fan-out to followers, done as a Postgres trigger on `posts`/`hotposts` insert rather than a client-side loop — a page can have a lot of followers, and a trigger either fans out atomically or doesn't touch anything, instead of half-completing if the tab closes mid-loop.

### New: chat notifications ("New Chat")
- `messages.js` now creates a `new_message` notification on every real send path (`sendChatMessage`, `sendPostToChat`, `retryFailedMessage`).
- Per your instruction, the push is deliberately generic — title "💬 New Chat", body "`<name>` sent you a message." — no message content, unlike comments/replies which do show a snippet. Chats are the one category here where content shouldn't land on a lock screen.
- **Per-conversation mute is respected**, but it has to happen in the edge function, not client-side: the app's existing mute (`conversation_settings.muted_until`) is only readable by its own owner under RLS, so the sender's browser can never check the recipient's mute state. The updated edge function checks it server-side with the service-role key before sending.

### Settings UI
- Added a "Messages" toggle next to the existing Likes/Comments/Mentions/Connections ones — pushes for chats can now be turned off independently.
- Added a **Muted Chats** list in the same Notifications settings screen, so every muted conversation is visible and un-mutable from one place, not just per-chat via each conversation's "⋯" menu. Reuses `messages.js`'s own `window.setChatMute` rather than writing a second, parallel implementation.

### ⚠️ Deploy steps, in order
1. Run `supabase/migration_notifications_fanout_v9.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.
2. Redeploy the edge function from `supabase/functions/push-notification-sender/index.ts` (`supabase functions deploy push-notification-sender`) — none of the client-side changes above do anything for likes/comments/mentions/connections/chats until this is live, since that's what actually sends the push.
3. Deploy the updated `main.js`, `feed.js`, `hotposts.js`, `messages.js`, `data-layer.js`, `index.html`.

### Notes / things I did not touch
- `manage_connection`'s SQL isn't in this repo, so connection notifications are hooked off its return value client-side rather than inside the RPC itself. If that RPC's possible return strings ever change, this needs updating alongside it.
- Didn't add a "which specific pages you follow can/can't notify you" audit beyond what already existed (`notification-settings-list` — unchanged).

## Search/Discover: the "Discover people" section that was never actually built
**Date**: September 12, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Fixed
- The empty-query Search tab's container was literally named `explore-users-container`, with an HTML comment reading "Discover Students / Pages" — but nothing had ever populated a people section there. It only ever showed the Featured Services grid. Meanwhile the app already has a complete, working "Suggested for you" system (`getUserSuggestions` in `data-layer.js`, `generateSuggestionsHTML` in `feed.js`) powering the feed's own inline widget and its "See All" panel — just never reused here.
- Reused it as-is: Search/Discover now shows a "Suggested for you" horizontal card row (same Connect/Follow buttons, same dismiss behavior, same "See All" link into the existing panel) above the Featured Services grid, instead of building a second version of the same feature.

### Notes
- Split `explore-users-container` into two sub-containers (`discover-suggested-users`, `discover-featured-services`) so the two fetches (suggestions, featured services) don't overwrite each other — the outer container's show/hide logic when you start typing a search is unchanged.
- `feed.js`'s `generateSuggestionsHTML` is now `export`ed and imported into `search.js`, same reuse pattern as `post-card.js` from earlier — no duplicated card markup.

---

## Profile page: story ring on your own avatar
**Date**: September 12, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Added
- Your profile-page avatar now shows the same story ring as the Hotpost tray (viewed/unviewed gray shades, kept in sync with the tray's own data) whenever you have an active Hotpost. Tapping it opens your Hotpost viewer — same `window.showMyHotposts()` the tray's own avatar already used, nothing new to maintain there.
- The ring stays current three ways: once at load, every time you switch to the Profile tab, and any time the tray itself re-renders (new post, marked viewed, etc.) — so it doesn't go stale if you post a Hotpost while already sitting on your profile.

### Changed
- Tapping the profile-page avatar no longer opens the upload file-picker directly — Edit Profile's existing "Edit picture" button (which already had its own working upload flow and already kept this same avatar in sync on success) is now the one way to change it. Removed the duplicate, now-orphaned `setupProfileAvatarUpload()` and its hidden `#avatar-upload-input`, which would otherwise have been dead code with no way to trigger it.

### Notes
- New helper: `window.getMyHotpostRingState()` in `hotposts.js`, reading the tray's own in-memory `hotpostsByUser` map — no extra query.

---

## Resolved the optimizeImageUrl duplicate: hotposts now use 720px/q_auto:low
**Date**: September 12, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Fixed
- `window.optimizeImageUrl` was defined twice in `main.js` (flagged, not fixed, in the previous update). The second definition silently won at runtime — same bug class as the old duplicate `openSinglePostView` — so hotpost images were actually being served at 600px/`q_auto:eco` this whole time, regardless of what the other (dead) definition intended.
- Decision: keep **720px/q_auto:low** going forward. Hotposts are viewed full-screen, and at that size blur reads as worse than compression artifacts — 600px visibly softens on any modern phone's pixel density, and stories are the first thing people see when they open the app, so that first impression is worth a bit more bandwidth. Removed the shadowed duplicate definition entirely.

### Notes
- If bandwidth/Cloudinary cost becomes a concern later, this is the one line to revisit: `main.js`, `optimizeImageUrl()`, the `hotpost` branch.

## Killed the feed.js/main.js post-card duplication (new post-card.js)
**Date**: September 12, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### What changed
Every post card in the app (feed.js's main feed, main.js's single-post/notification-link view) was two separately hand-maintained copies of the same ~300-line template. Every time this thread added something to the action row (Share, this week), it had to go in twice — exactly the failure mode duplication causes. New `post-card.js` is now the one place that markup lives; `renderPosts()` and `generatePostHTML()` are both thin wrappers around its `renderPostCardsHtml()`.

While diffing the two copies to merge them, found they'd already drifted apart in ways that were live bugs, not just style differences:

### Fixed (found only because they were being compared line-by-line)
- **Tapping a post author's name did nothing in the single-post view.** main.js's `<h4>` had `onclick="window.openPublicProfile(...)"` — a function that doesn't exist anywhere in the codebase — instead of the working `.profile-link` + `data-user-id` pattern feed.js used (delegated via a document-level click listener in both files). Tapping the name threw a console error and went nowhere. Tapping the *avatar* next to it still worked, purely by accident — it kept the working `.profile-link` class *in addition to* the same broken `onclick`, so the delegated handler fired anyway (after also throwing that same error).
- **Comment counts could differ between the feed and single-post view for the same post.** main.js filtered out commentless rows (`&& c.content`) before counting; feed.js didn't. Standardized on the more defensive one.
- Also pulled a *third* copy of the poll-rendering logic (options, quiz highlighting, vote totals, meta labels — everything inside `.poll-container-wrapper`) out of `window.updatePollUI` in feed.js, which had its own hand-copied version for the in-place refresh that runs right after you vote. That's now `renderPollBodyHtml()` in the same file, used by all three call sites.

### Also noticed, NOT touched
- `window.optimizeImageUrl` is defined **twice** in `main.js` (once with `hotpost` compression at `q_auto:low,w_720`, again later with `q_auto:eco,w_600`) — same silently-shadowed-by-a-later-definition bug as the old duplicate `openSinglePostView`. The later one wins, so hotpost images are compressed with the `eco/600` settings right now regardless of the first one's intent. Since this is a genuine product call (image quality vs. bandwidth) and not a correctness bug like the ones above, I left it alone rather than guess which setting you actually want — flagging it here so it doesn't get lost.

### Notes
- `post-card.js` exports `renderPostCardsHtml` (full card) and `renderPollBodyHtml` + `getPollTimeLeft` (poll internals, reused by the in-place vote refresh). `window.getTickHtml` and `window.optimizeImageUrl` are still accessed the same soft-global way (`typeof window.X === 'function'`) they always were — no change to load-order assumptions.

---

## Messages: chat header options menu + inbox search
**Date**: September 12, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Added
- A "⋯" button in the open-conversation header, wired to the exact same Pin/Mute/Archive/Delete menu the inbox row's long-press already used (`buildChatRowMenu`/`openChatRowMenu` — no new menu logic, just a second way to reach it). Previously the only way to pin, mute, archive, or delete a chat was to back out to the inbox list first.
- A search box above the All/Unread/Archived filter pills on the Messages tab, filtering the already-loaded thread list by name client-side (same approach as the share sheet's connection search from earlier today) — with its own "No results for '...'" empty state, separate from the existing "No messages yet" / "All caught up" ones.

### Fixed
- Archiving or deleting a chat from the *header* menu (new, since that menu used to only be reachable from the inbox where you're never inside the thread you're acting on) now also closes the conversation view if it's the one you're currently in — otherwise you'd archive/delete the chat you're looking at and nothing would visibly happen until you backed out manually.

### Notes
- DMs are still text/shared-post-only — no photo/file attachments in the composer. That's a bigger feature (upload flow + a new schema column) rather than a UI pass, so I held off on building it without checking first.

---

## Two bugs from the share feature, fixed same day
**Date**: September 12, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only (on top of the `shared_post_id` migration from earlier today)

### Fixed
- **Tapping a shared post inside a chat did nothing — until you hit back, and then it suddenly appeared.** `modal-single-post` (z-170) was sitting *underneath* `modal-chat-conversation` (z-180) in the stacking order. `openSinglePostView()` was firing correctly the whole time; it was just opening invisibly behind the chat, so closing the chat modal on top revealed a post view that had been open the whole time. Raised `modal-single-post` to z-190 so it now actually appears on top when triggered from inside a chat.
- **Redesigned the "Send to" sheet to match Instagram** instead of a plain stacked list: a search box up top, then a 4-column grid of round avatars (first name underneath, tap to send). Live search filters the grid client-side (no extra request). "Share externally" stays as its own row below the grid.

### Notes
- Grid cells use `data-name="<lowercased full name>"` for the search filter and just toggle Tailwind's `hidden` class — no separate JS array of connections to keep in sync with the DOM.
- The send-confirmation feedback moved from a status label next to a text row to a small badge in the corner of the avatar (spinner → checkmark), which is where Instagram puts it in the grid layout too.

## Share button: matched the nav icon, added in-app "Send to chat"
**Date**: September 12, 2026
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires SQL migration — run `supabase/migration_shared_posts_v7.sql` before deploying this update

### Added
- The feed's share icon now uses the exact same inline paper-plane SVG as the Messages tab in the bottom nav, instead of a Material Symbols "send" icon that didn't match it.
- **Real in-app sharing.** Tapping Share now opens a "Send to" sheet listing your connections (same cached `getAcceptedConnections` data path used everywhere else) — tap someone to send the post straight into your chat with them, with a spinner → checkmark on that row so it's clear it went through. "Share externally" (the OS share sheet / copy-link behavior from last update) is still there as its own row at the bottom of the same sheet — nothing was removed, just no longer the only option.
- Shared posts render as an actual card inside the chat bubble (thumbnail, author, caption snippet — tap to open the post), the same way story replies already show a Hotpost preview card. The inbox list shows "📤 Shared a post" instead of raw content for these.

### Database
- New nullable `messages.shared_post_id` column (FK to `posts`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`), added in `supabase/migration_shared_posts_v7.sql`. Mirrors the existing `messages.hotpost_reply_id` column exactly — no RLS/GRANT changes needed, it reuses the same connections-only insert policy. **This migration must be run before deploying the updated `main.js` / `feed.js` / `messages.js`**, or sharing to chat will fail (the column won't exist yet).

### Notes
- `messages.content` has a `NOT NULL, char_length(btrim(content)) > 0` constraint, so a shared-post message still carries a fixed fallback string ("Shared a post") in `content` — the UI never shows that text, it's suppressed in favor of the card, but it's there if you inspect the row directly.

---

## Feed post cards — added Share, fixed a silent clipboard bug, removed dead code
**Date**: September 10, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Added
- A **Share** button (paper-plane icon) next to Like/Comment on every post card — this was the one action row on the whole app with no way to share at all. Uses `navigator.share` on devices that support it, with a clipboard-copy fallback, same as the existing "share my profile" button.
- Shared links are real deep links (`?post=<id>`): opening one now takes you straight to that exact post, reusing the same routing `initializeApp()` already uses for notification taps — I didn't want to ship a share button that just copies a link to nowhere.

### Fixed
- `shareMyProfile()`'s fallback (non-`navigator.share` browsers) showed "Profile link copied to clipboard!" but never actually called `navigator.clipboard.writeText(...)` — nothing was copied. Now it is.
- Removed a dead, out-of-date duplicate of `window.openSinglePostView` in `main.js`. There were two definitions; because both just assign to `window.openSinglePostView`, the later one in the file silently wins and the first one — missing poll/event support and the reported-post filter — never ran. Harmless today, but a real risk if someone edited the wrong copy later. Kept the complete one.

### Notes
- `generatePostHTML` (main.js, single-post view) and `renderPosts` (feed.js, main feed) render near-identical post-card markup independently — I updated the action row in both so Share shows up in both contexts. Worth knowing about if you touch the action row again: it currently needs to change in two places.

---

## Story tray — merged the duplicate "you" avatar into one self-slot
**Date**: September 10, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Fixed
- Once you had an active Hotpost, the tray showed **two** circles of yourself side by side: a plain "Create" circle, then a separate "My Hotposts" circle with your story ring. Real story trays (Instagram included) only ever show one — your avatar with the ring if you have something active, and a small "+" badge on it to add another. Now there's a single self-slot that behaves that way: tap the avatar/ring to view your Hotposts, tap the "+" badge to open the camera, without one covering the other's tap target (`stopPropagation` on the badge).
- Before you post your first Hotpost, the slot still shows the original dimmed-avatar "Create" circle exactly as before — nothing changes there.
- Saves ~88px of horizontal tray space and removes the "wait, which one is me" moment of seeing two of yourself in the row.

### Notes
- Pure markup/logic change in `renderHotpostCircles()` — no new state, no DB changes, upload-in-progress placeholder is untouched.

---

## Hotpost "Who viewed this story" list — Instagram-style per-viewer actions
**Date**: September 10, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Added
- Every row in the viewers list now has a "⋯" button (reuses the app's existing bottom action-sheet component, same one Feed post options use) with: **View profile** (same destination as tapping the row), **Message** (only shown for accepted connections, matching how the Message button is gated everywhere else in the app — jumps straight into the conversation), and **Report** (opens the existing report-user flow). Previously the row was only tappable as a whole with no other affordance.
- Nicer empty state ("No views yet" with an icon) and a real **Try again** retry button on the error state — before, a failed load just showed static red text with no way to recover without closing and reopening the sheet.

### Notes
- No new tables/columns — this only wires up flows that already existed elsewhere in the app (action sheet, `openConversation`, `openReportModal`).
- Row tap-to-view-profile is unchanged; the new "⋯" button uses `stopPropagation` so it doesn't also trigger the row's own click.

---

## Real in-app webview (links no longer leave to a new tab)
**Date**: September 4, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Fixed
- Every "open in app" link (Featured Services, page services, service search results) was actually opening in a **new browser tab** when running as a PWA — `openServiceLink()` only had a real in-app path for compiled Capacitor native builds; the web/PWA path fell through to `window.open(url, '_blank')`, which leaves the app. That's what you were seeing while testing in Chrome.
- Added a genuine in-app webview: a full-screen modal with an `<iframe>`, a header (close / page title & hostname / reload / "open in browser"), and back-button support. `openServiceLink()` now routes here for the web/PWA case; the native Capacitor Browser-plugin path is untouched since that was already correct.
- This is the single shared function every link-opening call site already uses (page services, Featured Services, service search results) — fixed once, applies everywhere, no per-feature changes needed.

### Known limitation (browser platform, not fixable from here)
- Some sites send `X-Frame-Options` / `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` headers that block being embedded in an iframe at all — this is enforced by the *target site's server* and the browser, not something client-side JS can see or override. There's no reliable cross-origin way to detect this happened (no clean error fires). Handled with a best-effort 8-second load timeout: if nothing's loaded by then, the modal shows a "This page can't be shown here" state with an "Open in browser" fallback button instead of leaving a spinner running forever. Sites without that restriction (e.g. plain GitHub Pages, like the Talent Hunt link) embed fine.

## Featured Services icons now pass user details in the URL
**Date**: September 3, 2026
**Status**: Code only — see note below on SQL

### Added
- Tapping a Featured Services **icon** now appends the current user's details as query params before opening the link:
  - `student_id` — the person's `student_id` **offset by +5489** (e.g. student_id `"1"` → `student_id=5490`)
  - `name` — their full name
  - `theme` — `light` or `dark`, matching the app's current theme live (not just what it was on page load)
  - Example: student_id `1`, name `Nahul`, light theme → `...?student_id=5490&name=Nahul&theme=light`
- New `window.openFeaturedServiceLink()` in `search.js` builds this safely with the URL API (handles a link that already has its own query params, missing `https://`, etc.) and falls back to opening the raw link if anything about the URL is malformed, rather than the tap silently doing nothing
- This is scoped to the new Featured Services grid only — the pre-existing `page_services` links (on people's own profiles) are untouched, since real page owners already rely on `openServiceLink` behaving exactly as it did before

### SQL note
- No new migration needed for this — it's pure client-side URL building
- The seed data's "Talent Hunt" placeholder link is now the real one (`https://mohitmali5489.github.io/HUNT/`). If you already ran `migration_featured_services_v6.sql` before this, run the small `fix_talent_hunt_link.sql` once to update that one row — re-running the full seed would create duplicates

---

## Featured Services grid on Search (replaces "Suggested for you")
**Date**: September 3, 2026
**Status**: Requires running `supabase/migration_featured_services_v6.sql` before deploy

### Added
- The Search page's default (empty-query) view now shows a curated "Featured Services" grid instead of the suggested-users list — grouped cards by provider ("By ClassCount", "By GreenClub", ...), each with up to a few icon+label items, matching the reference screenshot layout exactly
- New `featured_services` table — fully independent from the existing `page_services` table (which page owners manage themselves). This one has **no in-app write path at all**: no insert/update/delete RLS policy exists, so it's only editable directly in the Supabase table editor, by design ("manage completely" separately)
- Seeded with the exact 5 groups × 3 items from the screenshot (ClassCount, GreenClub, BAFs App, ECampus, Kalamandal) — all placeholder `link_url` values and `provider_user_id` left `NULL`, ready for you to fill in real links and wire up each provider's actual Page account
- Tapping an **icon** opens that item's `link_url` (reuses the existing `window.openServiceLink`, same in-app-browser/Capacitor behavior as `page_services`). Tapping the **card** anywhere else opens `provider_user_id`'s profile — or a "not linked yet" toast if that provider hasn't been wired up
- Offline support: cached in IndexedDB the same way the old suggestions list was, so it still renders (from cache) with no connection. Bumped the local DB schema version (4→5) to add the new cache store

### Notes
- The "Suggested for you" *feed widget* (different feature, lives on the main Feed tab, added a few rounds back) is untouched — this only replaces the Search tab's default view

---

## Hotpost-reply preview in chat (Instagram-style thumbnail)
**Date**: September 2, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Added
- The "↩ Replied to your/their story" text label in chat now shows an actual thumbnail of the Hotpost next to it — a small image (or a play icon for video Hotposts), same idea as Instagram's story-reply preview in DMs. Tapping it reopens that Hotpost directly (jumps straight to that specific post in the person's story stack, not just their first one)
- Wording changed from "story" to "Hotpost" to match this app's actual terminology (checked: the viewer itself already says "Your Hotpost", not "Your Story" — the earlier label was inconsistent with that)
- `hotposts.js`'s `openHotpostViewer(userId)` now optionally takes a second `targetPostId` argument to jump to a specific post instead of always starting at the first unviewed one; falls back to a toast ("This Hotpost is no longer available") if that post has expired/been deleted, rather than silently failing

### Notes
- No new database changes — this reuses the same `hotposts` read access the story viewer already relies on
- If a Hotpost's row is gone (deleted) by the time someone views the chat, the preview gracefully degrades to the old text-only label instead of showing a broken image

---

## Message button on profile + Hotpost replies now go to Messages
**Date**: September 2, 2026
**Status**: Requires running `supabase/migration_hotpost_replies_v5.sql` before deploy

### Added
- "Message" button on a connection's profile (next to "✓ Connected") — jumps straight into the conversation, same as tapping them in the inbox
- Replying to a Hotpost (story) now sends a real DM instead of writing to the old, separate `hotpost_replies` table — Instagram-style. The message bubble shows a small "↩ Replied to your/their story" label so the context isn't lost once the conversation moves on; the inbox preview gets a "↩" prefix too
- New `messages.hotpost_reply_id` column (nullable, FK to hotposts) carries this

### Changed
- **Replying to a story is now connections-only**, matching DMs. This falls out almost for free: story replies go through the exact same `messages_insert_connected_sender` RLS policy as any other message, which already requires an accepted connection between sender and receiver — no new policy needed. The reply box (text input + send) is hidden client-side for non-connections; the like button stays visible for everyone, unaffected
- Removed the "Replies" tab from Story Insights (Viewers/Likes/Replies → Viewers/Likes) — replies live entirely in Messages now, so a separate list would just be a second, out-of-sync place to look
- The old `hotpost_replies` table is left in place (not dropped) — no new rows get written to it, but historical data isn't deleted. Safe to drop later if you're sure you don't need it.

## "See All" suggestions — full list panel
**Date**: August 29, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Added
- The "See All" link on the feed's "Suggested for you" widget previously just switched to the Search tab (a generic, unrelated view). It now opens a dedicated full-screen list of up to 60 suggestions (vs. the widget's 12), each row with Connect/Follow and a dismiss (✕) — same actions as the widget, just as a proper scrollable list instead of a horizontal rail
- `getUserSuggestions(userId, limit)` in `data-layer.js` now takes an optional limit (defaults to 12, unchanged for the widget) instead of being hardcoded — the panel requests 60. Cache keys are limit-aware so the widget and the full list don't clobber each other's cached results

### Changed
- Deduplicated the Follow/Connect button markup between the widget's cards and the new list rows into one shared `suggestionActionBtn()` — same reasoning as the earlier tick-badge cleanup, one copy instead of two that can drift apart

---

## Popup menu polish — no more fly-in flash, closes on scroll
**Date**: August 29, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Fixed
- The popup menu's own positioning logic (`popup-menu-card` in `index.html`) used `transition-all`, which also animated the `left`/`top` jump from its off-screen measurement point to the real spot — the "flies in from somewhere else" visible flash. Scoped the transition to `transition-[opacity,transform]` only, so repositioning is instant and only the fade/scale-in animates.
- The popup didn't close when the page (or any scrollable container behind it — chat history, feed, inbox list) scrolled. Added a capture-phase `scroll` listener that closes it, since native scroll events don't bubble.

## Posts v5 — Report reason bug fix + "more options" popup menu
**Date**: August 29, 2026
**Status**: No SQL changes — code only

### Fixed
- **Report Post always failed validation, even with a reason selected.** The custom reason picker was writing to a hidden input with `id="report-reason"`, but `submitPostReport()` read from `id="report-post-reason"` — an element that didn't exist. This also collided with the *separate*, legitimate `id="report-reason"` `<select>` used by the Report User flow (the duplicate ID flagged earlier in this project). Renamed the post-report hidden input to `report-post-reason`, retargeted the picker to match, and both flows are now correctly isolated. Also fixed: closing the modal now resets the visible label back to "-- Select a reason --" instead of leaving stale text from a previous post.

### Changed — Post "more options" (⋮) menu
- Converted from the full-width bottom sheet to the same anchored popup menu used by Messages — opens right next to the ⋮ button instead of sliding up from the bottom
- Removed a fully dead, byte-identical duplicate of `openPostOptions` (+ duplicate `endPollEarly`/`togglePostSetting`) that silently did nothing since the later definition always overwrote it — same class of bug already found and fixed in the tick-badge and `openSinglePostView` cleanup
- `popupMenuItem`, previously a Messages-only helper, moved to `ui.js` and is now shared by both Messages and the post options menu — avoids re-introducing the same "copy-pasted UI, drifts out of sync" problem the tick-badge fix addressed
- No new options added and no removed actions — same Archive/Unarchive, Hide/unhide likes, Turn on/off commenting, Delete Post (owner), Report Post (non-owner) as before, just restyled and better-positioned

---

## Posts v4 — Report-hides-until-verified + expiry/label fixes
**Date**: August 28, 2026
**Status**: Requires running `supabase/migration_posts_v4.sql` before deploy

### Added
- Reported posts are now hidden from everyone (feed, profiles, saved/liked/archived lists, direct links) the moment a report is filed against them — new `posts.is_reported` column, set by a DB trigger on `reports` INSERT (additive, doesn't touch the existing `report_post` RPC)
- Setting `is_verified = true` on a post (however you do that today, e.g. Supabase table editor) automatically clears the report flag and brings it back — one action, not two

### Changed
- Your own profile grid and other people's public profiles no longer show expired posts (`expires_at` filter added — profile grids never had this, unlike the main feed which already did)
- Removed the gold "Verified" badge shown on posts (both `main.js` and `feed.js` had an identical copy of it) — `is_verified` still exempts a post from being reported, it's just no longer publicly labeled

### Scope notes
- Saved/Liked/Archived lists and the single-post deep-link view intentionally still show expired posts (matches this app's existing "your archive/saved posts stay reachable" design) — only the moderation (is_reported) filter applies there, not the expiry one
- No new GRANTs needed; both new triggers are DB-side

---

## Messages v3 — Pin / Mute / Archive / Delete + Popup Menus
**Date**: August 27, 2026
**Status**: Requires running `supabase/migration_messages_v3.sql` before deploy

### Added
- Pin chat (PINNED section, pin badge on avatar, unlimited pins)
- Mute chat with duration (8 hours / 1 week / Always), bell-slash icon on muted rows, muted threads no longer light up the nav badge
- Archive chat — dedicated Archived Chats panel with inline restore/delete icons per row
- Delete chat — hides the thread for you only; reappears automatically if they message you again (messages aren't erased)
- Quick-access avatar rail at the top of Messages (online dot, tap to jump into a chat)
- All / Unread filter pills on the inbox
- New reusable **anchored popup menu** component — replaces the bottom sheet for the chat-row menu (Pin/Mute/Archive/Delete) and the message-bubble long-press menu (Reply/Copy/React/Unsend/Delete); auto-flips to stay on-screen, closes on outside tap or the hardware back button

### Schema
- New table `conversation_settings` (user_id, partner_id) → pinned, muted_until, archived, deleted_at
- Explicit `GRANT` statements included this time (see the v2 hotfix notes)

### Scope notes
- Pin/mute/archive/delete are per-device-agnostic (stored server-side), but not realtime-synced across a user's own multiple open sessions — a second tab picks up the change on its next inbox refresh, not instantly
- "Delete chat" only affects the inbox list; opening the conversation directly (e.g. via the quick-access rail) still shows full history

---

## Messages v2 — Native Chat Feel
**Date**: August 27, 2026
**Status**: Requires running `supabase/migration_messages_v2.sql` before deploy

### Added
- Delivery/read ticks (sent → delivered → read, WhatsApp-style)
- Typing indicator + app-wide online presence, "Last seen" fallback
- Reply-to-message (swipe-to-reply on touch, long-press menu on desktop/mobile)
- Emoji reactions (quick-react bar, grouped pills under bubbles, realtime synced)
- Unsend (10-min window, server-enforced via trigger) and Delete-for-me
- Infinite scroll / pagination for chat history (40/page), scroll position preserved
- Scroll-to-bottom FAB with unread-since-scrolled badge
- Incremental inbox updates on new messages (no more full refetch per message)
- Per-conversation draft persistence, retry-on-failed-send, auto-linked URLs
- Keyboard-safe layout via visualViewport, haptics on send/react/reply/long-press

### Schema
- `messages`: + `reply_to_id`, `delivered_at`, `is_unsent`, `deleted_for_sender`, `deleted_for_receiver`
- `users`: + `last_active_at`
- New table `message_reactions` (one reaction per user per message)
- RLS widened to sender+receiver on `messages` UPDATE; unsend window enforced by DB trigger regardless of client

### Deferred (by design, for now)
- OS-level push notifications when the app is closed/backgrounded

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Architecture
```
BEFORE:
- Direct API calls scattered throughout
- No caching layer
- Duplicate queries on same page
- Memory leaks from event listeners

AFTER:
- Centralized data-layer module
- Smart TTL caching
- Request deduplication
- Proper cleanup on tab switch
```

### Data Flow
```
USER ACTION
    ↓
data-layer.js (cache check)
    ├─ Cache HIT → return instantly (no API call)
    └─ Cache MISS → fetch from API
        ├─ Check for in-flight request
        ├─ If exists → return same promise
        └─ If new → fetch and cache result

RESULT → Render to UI
```

### Memory Management
```
BEFORE:
- Camera stream: kept active after close
- Object URLs: never revoked
- Event listeners: accumulated
- Realtime subscriptions: multiple without cleanup
- Timers: not cleared

AFTER:
- Camera stream: properly stopped and nullified
- Object URLs: revoked after use
- Event listeners: cleaned up on tab switch
- Realtime subscriptions: unsubscribed on cleanup
- Timers: cleared on cancel
```
